## Summary

The run_analysis.R file is a script that can generate two data frames. This document will cover how these frames can be generated and the variables that they contain. The first data frame can be generated by calling the getSummary function without any parameters. The second data frame can be generated by calling getAverages and passing it the output of the getSummary function. If you would like to generate a csv files of these data frames call the run function which should produce two csv files summary.csv and averages.csv.

The variables of these data frames are taken from the features_info.txt and features.txt documents in this directory.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
